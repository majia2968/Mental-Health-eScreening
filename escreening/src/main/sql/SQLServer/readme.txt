On April 19th, 2018 We determined that the trigger created by the script titled TriggerVeteranAssessment which is used to populate a table
that is later used for creating the 20 Most Skipped Questions report causes major performance issues.

DO NOT run the script titled DO_NOT_USE_S4_TriggerVeteranAssessment.sql until it has been refactored.

The script is being preserved in case future refactoring efforts are to be made.
